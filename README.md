PROJECT SCOPE (100 words)
----------------------------------
Have you ever felt so lazy, that you don't want to make your own drink? But of course... You still want a drink delivered in style (none of this pre-mix rubbish)

I present to you our robotic bartender! His only goal is to present you with the finest of mixed beverages, and look good while doing it!

We have chosen this project because we wanted to create something interesting, whilst still technically challenging ourselves. We also like this concept because it opens up the opportunity to use a multi-armed robot.

To acomplish this task, we will be using MATLAB and Peter Corkes Robotics Toolbox to simulate the environemnt of the robot and the movements of the robot.

The plan is to have the robotic arms complete a number of motions which will enable it to pour a drink, stir a drink and mix a drink. An environment will be built around it to secure the robot and serve the bottles to the robotic arm (via a rotating plate).

ROBOTIC ARM CHOICE (100 words)
----------------------------------
After significant consideration about robotic arm choice, we decided to move ahead with two Epson Flexion N6 robotic arms. These arms are fantastic collaborative robots, built by a reputable company. Their payload capacity of 6kg means they are definitely strong enough to handle any moving or pouring motions that may be required.

The end effector choice is the DH robotics AG-95, chosen for it's 3kg payload capacity and it's ability to mate with our robot (though DH robotics do a great job of ensuring their end effectors are compatible with just about all collaborative robots on the market).

This combination of robotic arms and end effectors will allow us to achieve the goal of a bartending robotic duo!
