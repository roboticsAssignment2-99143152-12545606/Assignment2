PROJECT SCOPE (100 words)
----------------------------------
We will be simulating a robotic bartender.

A robotic arm will collect a pattern of drinks and pour them into the target glass.

We have chosen this project because we wanted to create something interesting, whilst still being technically challenging. We also like this concept because it opens up the opportunity to use one robot, two robots or a multi-armed robot.

To acomplish this task, we will be using MATLAB and Peter Corkes Robotics Toolbox.

The plan is to have the robotic arms complete a number of motions which will enable it to pour a drink, stir a drink and mix a drink. An environment will be built around it to secure the robot and serve the bottles to the robotic arm (via a rotating plate).

ROBOTIC ARM CHOICE (100 words)
----------------------------------
We have settled on robots from ABB, largely because we wanted to chose something different from the robots available in class. 

The ABB robots are different, however still supported well by the manufacturer, meaning we have full technical drawings and 3D models.

% This option is for the two-armed robot

We have decided to use the two-armed robot supplied by ABB for two key reasons.
1. It doubles our ability to collect and pour drinks, increasing the system speed
2. It adds complexity and makes the project more appealing

% This option is for the single-armed robot

We have decided to use the one-armed robot supplied by ABB.

A few notes on the robots I just realised
- 7 DOF > added difficulty
- 500g payload capacity (maybe acceptable - not great)
