PROJECT SCOPE (100 words)
----------------------------------
We will be simulating a robotic bartender.

A robotic arm will collect a pattern of drinks and pour them into the target glass. We have chosen this project because we wanted to create something interesting, whilst still being technically challenging.

To acomplish this task, we will be using MATLAB and Peter Corkes Robotics Toolbox.
