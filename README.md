PROJECT SCOPE (100 words)
----------------------------------
We will be simulating a robotic bartender.

A robotic arm will collect a pattern of drinks and pour them into the target glass.

We have chosen this project because we wanted to create something interesting, whilst still being technically challenging. We also like this concept because it opens up the opportunity to use one robot, two robots or a multi-armed robot.

To acomplish this task, we will be using MATLAB and Peter Corkes Robotics Toolbox.

The plan is to have the robotic arms complete a number of motions which will enable it to pour a drink, stir a drink and mix a drink. An environment will be built around it to secure the robot and serve the bottles to the robotic arm (via a rotating plate).
